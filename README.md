How It's Made: Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Floats , Media queries

Deciding to use Floats for this project instead of more user friendly CSS frame works was a daunting, but ultimately worthwhile challenge.
Many clients and businesses still utilize floats for positioning. It can be tempting to always use frame works like Flex and Grid however 
I feel like it was an invaluable opportunity to really familiarize myself with using Floats!

Optimizations:

This one had the most optimizations so far. It was really intriguing to reason out how to make good media quires without using a CSS framework.
It required me to really gain a good understanding of my own code base as well as the intricasicies of the various html elements I needed to adjust
in order to provide a cohesive experience all the devices for users.

This really helped me get over my anxiety around using Floats and made me appricate their overall contribution to the art of positioning
